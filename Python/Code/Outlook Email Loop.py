# Short title: Python Coded Mail-merge Loop
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Longer description:
# As occasionally happens, I found myself creating a report for some teaching evaluation activity, and needing to send
# each Chair their report that I had made for them via Outlook email attachment. Typically this would involve opening
# 35-odd emails and crafting each by hand. I had looked into making a mail-merge with attachments, never had any luck.
# I didn't want to install anyone's add-ons. 

# Thought I'd Google it again, and stumbled across a fascinating youtube series: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7_bW45G_1o
# Copied the instructions, and by golly, it worked.

# In this example, I basically just was going from my folder of reports, which happened to have Chair names in the file names.
# I made a list of the reports (file names), harvested the Chair names, and used them as the addressees (Outlook would check
# the names and look up the email addresses) and attached the appropriate file. I ended up with all of those 35 shells I would
# have made by hand within 10 seconds, after clicking "run".

# The only thing to keep in mind is you need to get your message into HTML format. There are some websites that will let
# you copy-paste your rich text and get HTML out of it. (eg. https://wordtohtml.net/)
