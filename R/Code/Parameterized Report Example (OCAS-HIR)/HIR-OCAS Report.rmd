# A Word Report Example - by Fraser Hay (CONS) - fhay {at} conestogac.on.ca
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# Greetings earthlings, welcome to this self-contained example of making a parameterized report.

# REQUIREMENTS
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# In order for this report to work, you'll need the following things:

# - An internet connection - we're going to be pulling some images as well as some functions from the CIRPA CodeShare 
#   GitHub (https://github.com/cirpa-acpri/codeshare)
devtools::source_url("https://github.com/cirpa-acpri/codeshare/blob/master/R/Code/Survey%20Data%20Functions.R?raw=TRUE")

# FILES:
# - HIR-OCAS Report.rmd       (This file, obviously)
# - Style.docx    (A template Word file for R to base the report output on)
# - data.rds      (The fake data in the table structure of the OCAS-HIR data)

# LIBRARIES:
# - These need to be installed in your R instance in order to be loaded. See the "packages" tab on the left-bottom pane.
library(knitr)
library(tidyverse)
library(flextable)
library(officer)

# QUICK START:
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# If all you want to do is run it, skip to the 'RUN' section below.

# INTRO:
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# This was created for the IRPNG OCAS Hackathon event (Fall 2022) for the OCAS-HIR person-level dataset. The crux of this
# example report is to give recruiters information about a municipality: top highschools creating applications / enrolment,
# and for those applicants, top Colleges and subjects they applied to and enrolled in.

# This is an RMarkdown document (.RMD), which means it includes basic text and code chunks to run. The file therefore is a 
# self-contained report that includes the data references, transformations, and text used to generate it, so it can be 
# adjusted or re-run.

# Making RMarkdown export to Word is easy, but getting it to look good (or rather, something other than very basic) is a 
# bit harder, since we don't benefit from using native commands in Word to specify formatting. The mainstream approach is
# to use a template document that has formatting template info - "styles" - within it that we invoke when we want to make
# text appear in different ways. So, if I want nice small formatting underneath a figure, I need to create a style in my
# template document that has a name and is just the size/colour/format I want, after which I can "call" the format in my 
# report by using "fences" in the main text, like so:
#     ::: {custom-style="ScriptNote"} 
#     Note: 2022 Registration numbers are incomplete
#     :::
# Using this approach, you can make various headings, script faces and such. And your template document can have headers
# and footers and page numbers and graphics baked into it, if you like.

# Just going to note two additional useful commands that are in this report:  

#     /newpage      

# - Generates a new page / page break (you could also do this by defining a text style with a break)

#     {"\\begin{comment}"} and {"\\end{comment}"}     

# - Allows you to make text sections that appear or not based on logic you specify. See example in this report, for the 
#   College-specific section. Every comment beginning needs an end, mind you, otherwise it doesn't work.

# More information about making reports in R is available here: https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/

# DATA:
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# This example will reference a temporary data file, but it was originally built to use the full set of OCAS-HIR data.
# You could always change the source of the data to the HIR datasources by subbing them out after loading them in. For 
# instance, if you had the data uploaded into SQL, you could use something like the following to access it:
#     library(odbc)
#     library(dbplyr)
#     con <- dbConnect(odbc(), driver = "SQL Server", server = "<server name>", database = "<database name>")
#     data = dplyr::tbl(con, in_schema(sql("<database name>.<schema>"),"<table name>"))
# Feel free to reach out to me if you'd like help hooking up R to an SQL server.

# Alternately, if you're just working with the CSVs, you should load them in R and then save them as an .RDS,
# which is a compressed file and much faster to load. Here's how to crunch a csv into a .RDS and load it:
#     saveRDS(read.csv(file = "<path to .CSV file>"), file = "<file to save to>.RDS")
#     data = readRDS(file = "<file to save to>.RDS")

# As it is, the data.rds that ships out with this example is completely fake - shuffled beyond recognition. But the
# data structure (of the tables) matches the OCAS-HIR schema. (Eg. there's a table with the patterns of activity,
# one for demographics, post-secondary records, highschool averages). I'm naming things, for the different tables, as 
# below:
data = readRDS("data.rds")
patterns = data[['patterns']]
demos = data[['demos']]
edu = data[['edu']]
pse = data[['pse']]
# BONUS: I'm including a MIDENT lookup table which includes current and historical values. An amazing value!
MIDENT_lookup = data[['MIDENT_lookup']]

# FURTHER NOTES:
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# - Use parameterized reports whenever you have recurring reporting needs you tend to do over and over again, or have
#   a fairly similar report people want done many different ways, on demand.
# - Dashboards are cool; reports tell stories. Use your dashboards to find the parameters for your recurring reports, 
#   and use paramaterized reports to fill the gap between raw data exploration and deep dives into subjects.
# - You can make .RMDs modular, where they take input and give output. Then you create another .RMD file that calls them
#   on an as-needed basis for a unique reporting job. I've done this for an LMI machine I have, where I may (or may not)
#   specify various types of codes / sections to be included.
# - You could hook an .RMD report generator up to a command line and pass parameters in that call, rather than opening
#   up the RStudio interface for such things. This then means you could make a server generate reprots based on API
#   calls. I'm not saying I've done it but I could see a way to do it.
# - You will probably get some warning messages when you run this. Warnings are fine - they simply are advisories,
#   typically that an approach is bad form or may someday be depreciated. But it works for now, so, it's fine! :P

# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# RUN
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

# USE INSTRUCTIONS
# - If you've previously run the report, close the file. In order to create a new report, it needs to be able to
#   overwrite the previous file - and it can't do that if it's open.
# - Define the municipality you want to analyze (filter the data for). (Eg. 'Barrie')
# - Optionally, specify a College you specifically want to analyze the trends for (Eg. "Conestoga")
# - Knit the document (button at the top) - defaults to Word.
# - Output will be exported and should open when completed.

# Define Target(s)
# ============================================================================================
# City target
area = "Milton"   # City / municipal area (eg. "Barrie")

# College target - Name one College (eg. "Conestoga")

# Recruitment Report {-}

This report provides high-level historical trend numbers for recruiters who are traveling to a prospective area. This **data** is sourced from the **OCAS HIR Person-level Dataset** (Fall 2022).

## Parameters

Municipal area selected: **`r Area`**

Intake Term: **`r Term`**

```{r}
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# Hi, Fraser here, in a random code chunk!
# 
# I just wanted to make a note of what's happening immediately below. The next statement invloves in-line R code.
# (`r <code>`) This means instead of interpreting the characters as text to be shown on the page, R will take the
# code back-stage and run it then return the result. This lets us conditionally add things to our rendered report
# content.
# 
# The first `r` line below checks if the person has NOT made a college specification in the start-up chunk. If
# the variable is blank (the default), it will just return empty space. If however they have put a College in there,
# it will paste in a summary line for that College.
# 
# The second `r` line is a sneaky one: because it hides an entire section from the finished report content by
# invoking a COMMENT section, which essentially makes all the regular content within the \\begin{comment} and 
# \\end{comment} delimiters not appear on the page. This is one way of making "conditional sections" in your
# reports. Another would be to conditionally run other (child) .RMD report files and merge in the results.
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
