[**R**](https://www.r-project.org/) is a programming language and free software environment for statistical computing and graphics supported by the R Foundation for Statistical Computing. The R language is widely used among statisticians and data miners for developing statistical software and data analysis. It includes a system to disseminate user-written packages that enables its features to continuously grow. Although R has a command line interface, there are several graphical user interfaces, such as [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/), an integrated development environment.

## How to Download a file
You can easily download or work with files by creating your own clone or fork of parts of the CIRPA repository. But if you just want to download a single file:
1. Click on the file/script you want.
2. Right-click the "Raw" button on the top of the file's text box interface.

## Getting started in R
There are many ways to go about starting and learning R. Google will let you dive into many of these. 

Our preferred way to jump in for beginners is to simply [download and install R](http://cran.utstat.utoronto.ca/) itself, then [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) (or a similar integrated development environment (IDE)). Launch RStudio, and you're ready to start playing with the code!
